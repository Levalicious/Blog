# Hello!

I'm Lev. I have opinions. Sometimes, I share them. Other times, I focus on topics of interest, which include, but are not limited to:
 - Logic Systems
 - Genetic Programming
 - Compilers
 - VMs (the programming language kind, not the operating system kind)
 - Cryptography
 - P2P Systems
 - Blockchains

I tend to microoptimize a lot of things unnecessarily, as you'll probably see here at some point. My main programming language is C, although I have been known to dabble, and I'm currently working on a programming language tentatively called "C\\".

I just graduated from Michigan State University with my bachelors, so we'll see where that takes me.
